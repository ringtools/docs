Since you also need some sats to open, close and perhaps reopen a channel it is recommended to have at least 40.000 sats in your wallet on top of the amount of sats you need to open your channel. That means if you participate in a 500.000 sats ring, have 540.000 sats in your on-chain wallet. Why is the channel size of my channel lower than the amount I entered when opening? In the channel overview of Umbrel, after opening the commit fee is deducted from the full capacity. This is better explained as a reservation of the on-chain fees when the channel is closed unilaterally. Why can't I spend or receive the full amount visible on one side of a channel? A fixed amount (often 1% by default) is reserved on each side on the channel in the case you need to force-close a channel.","title":"Frequently asked questions"},{"location":"faq/#frequently-asked-questions","text":"","title":"Frequently asked questions"},{"location":"faq/#how-many-sats-do-i-need-to-open-a-channel-when-joining-a-ring","text":"Since you also need some sats to open, close and perhaps reopen a channel it is recommended to have at least 40.000 sats in your wallet on top of the amount of sats you need to open your channel.

Instructions Install dependencies with yarn install Configure settings by modifying .env Make sure custom custom LND PubSub server is running Start development server with yarn start Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ Umbrel Required modification of lnd.conf when using Umbrel When using Umbrel, LND is configured to only accept connections of other dockerized applications. This is very secure, but makes it impossible to connect to outside of the Umbrel docker network. To use this web-application using dsbaars/srrof-lnd-pubsub-python you need to reconfigure your LND instance so it will accept connections from your LAN. Alternatively you could add the LND PubSub Server to the existing Umbrel network but that is likely to break when you are updating Umbrel. Warning : Although in my opinion this is a safe modification, do not trust me blindly. Please understand the basics of what the effects of this modification are. Proceed at your own risk. The LND gRPC API Reference and the Imports and Client section of the Python information should help you understand. At the time of writing this documentation, two things are needed in order to make a gRPC request to an lnd instance: a TLS/SSL connection and a macaroon used for RPC authentication. Note that when an IP address is used to connect to the node (e.g. 192.168.1.21 instead of localhost) you need to add --tlsextraip=192.168.1.21 to your lnd configuration and re-generate the certificate (delete tls.cert and tls.key and restart lnd). What you are doing will regenerate your TLS certificates so it will include the IP-address and the hostname of your umbrel node. Important : Although both the certificate and the private key are regenerated, you only need the certificate itself. If you are going to run the PubSub server externally, you only need to copy tls.cert and the readonly.macaroon . Instructions Note : You will have to restart LND to apply the changes. Make a backup of your lnd.conf cd ~/umbrel/lnd cp lnd.conf lnd.conf.bak Open the text editor (e.g. nano ~/umbrel/lnd/lnd.conf of your choice and add tlsextraip=<your ip> below the existing tlsextraip= line. Just below the new entry, add another tlsextradomain= entry so it contains two entries in total: tlsextradomain=umbrel.local tlsextradomain=umbrel Save and close the text editor Restart lnd cd ~/umbrel docker-compose restart lnd Wait until your node comes up again and that Umbrel still works, if not copy back the backpu config file and try again. You can verify that multiple tlsextraip and tlsextradomain are allowed at Line 44 of the sample config . Also you can read that tlsautorefresh=1 automatically regenerates the necessary files, so although stated in their own guide, no deletion is required. You might need to restart other Umbrel services since the TLS certificate is probably used by other Umbrel apps as well.","title":"Local Instance"},{"location":"web/local-install/#local-instance","text":"To use RingTools-web on your own machine, you also need a backend.","title":"Local Instance"},{"location":"web/local-install/#instructions","text":"Install dependencies with yarn install Configure settings by modifying .env Make sure custom custom LND PubSub server is running Start development server with yarn start Navigate to http://localhost:4200/","title":"Instructions"},{"location":"web/local-install/#umbrel","text":"","title":"Umbrel"},{"location":"web/local-install/#required-modification-of-lndconf-when-using-umbrel","text":"When using Umbrel, LND is configured to only accept connections of other dockerized applications.
