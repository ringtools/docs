# Convenience features

All convenience features are optional to use. The bot will not announce your registration in public channels.

## Remember country

You can say `/set_country [2-letter country code]` in a DM to [@ringtools_bot](https://t.me/ringtools_bot), so you don't have type this every time you join a ring.

## Remember (multiple) nodes

You can register your node after verification so you don't have to type your public key after saying `/participate`. Say `/add_node` in a DM to [@ringtools_bot](https://t.me/ringtools_bot) and follow the wizard. 

Next time you do `/participate` in a ring you can select your node using buttons, if you have multiple nodes then multiple buttons will be shown.
