"Since you also need some sats to open, close and perhaps reopen a channel"
" it is recommended to have at least 40.000 sats in your wallet on top of "
"the amount of sats you need to open your channel. That means if you "
"participate in a 500.000 sats ring, have 540.000 sats in your on-chain "
"wallet.&#x20;"
